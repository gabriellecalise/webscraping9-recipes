 Apple Slice Pancakes

Jazz up regular pancakes with apple and cinnamon.

Ingredients 1  apple (Granny Smith) 1 1/4 cups pancake mix (any type) 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1  large egg 2 teaspoons canola oil 1 cup milk, low-fat
DirectionsLightly coat a griddle or skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
Peel, core and thinly slice apple into rings.
In a large mixing bowl, combine ingredients for pancake batter. Stir until ingredients are evenly moist. (Small lumps are ok! Over-mixing makes pancakes tough.)
For each pancake, place apple ring on griddle and pour about 1/4 cup batter over apple ring, starting in the center and covering the apple.
Cook until bubbles appear. Turn and cook other side until lightly brown.
